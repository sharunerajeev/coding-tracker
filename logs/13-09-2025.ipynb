    "### Problem 1: Queue Using Stacks\n",
    "Implement a First In First Out (FIFO) queue using stacks only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the UserQueue class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- void push(int X) : Pushes element X to the back of the queue.\n",
    "- int pop() : Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n",
    "- int peek() : Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "- boolean empty() : Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.\n",
    "Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations."
